# WEBSCRAPING_001
Greetings to all !!
This is a webscraping sample tool created by myself.
This is developed in Python programming language.And used various libraries such as BeautifulSoup and PlayWright.
This Python project scrapes structured data from Y Combinator company pages. It demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python libraries. 
Key Functionalities: • Extracts data including Company Details such as Company Name ,Founders,Location ,Team size, Social media profiles etc and Founder Details like Name ,Role,Profiles etc  from individual Y Combinator company pages. • Handles both static and dynamic website content. • Processes data in batches for efficiency (ideal for large datasets). • Saves extracted data in JSON format (customizable) like  Company Details as one json object and Founder Details as another for each company. 
Libraries Used: • Beautiful Soup (efficiently parses static HTML content) • Playwright (handles dynamic content and browser automation) • Pandas (structures and manipulates extracted data) 
Note: This is a non-commercial project and may not be suitable for high-volume scraping scenarios. 
Getting Started (Optional): • Install required Python libraries (pip install beautifulsoup4 playwright pandas) • Update the script with your desired data points and output format.
